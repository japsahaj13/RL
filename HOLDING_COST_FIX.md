# Holding Cost Fix Implementation

## Problem Summary

The reinforcement learning (RL) agent for retail pricing optimization was struggling with unrealistically high holding costs, which resulted in negative profits despite improving learning performance. Analysis showed that the holding cost parameters were set to unrealistic values:

- Storage fee: $2.00 per unit per period (40% of typical item cost per period)
- Spoilage percentage: 2% per period (24% annually)

These parameters resulted in maximum holding costs of up to 350% of inventory value, which is far from realistic retail operations where typical holding costs range from 15-30% annually.

## Solution Implemented

The following changes were made to fix the holding cost calculation:

1. **Parameter Adjustments**:
   - Storage fee reduced from $2.00 to $0.15 (92.5% reduction)
   - Spoilage percentage reduced from 2% to 0.2% (90% reduction)
   - Annual finance rate kept at 12% (reasonable cost of capital)

2. **Alternative Holding Cost Model**:
   - Added a linear holding cost model as an optional alternative to the logistic function
   - Linear model uses a simple formula: `base_rate + eir * excess_penalty`
   - Base rate: 5% of unit cost
   - Excess penalty: additional 5% at maximum excess

3. **Implementation**:
   - Updated the `MSMEConfig` class in `environments/config.py` with the new default values
   - Modified the `calculate_holding_cost` method to support both models
   - Updated all configuration files in the `config/` directory
   - Created utility scripts for analyzing and implementing the fixes

## Results

Simulations with the updated parameters showed significant improvements:

| Model | Holding Cost to Revenue | Profit |
|-------|------------------------|--------|
| Original | 143.8% | -$12,977 |
| Fixed Logistic | 31.6% | -$10,996 |
| Linear | 6.1% | -$11,204 |

While profits remain negative (likely due to other factors in the simulation), the holding costs are now at more realistic levels relative to inventory value and revenue.

## Files Updated

- `environments/config.py`: Updated default parameters and added linear model support
- `utilities/holding_rate.py`: Updated example parameters in the main function
- Configuration files in `config/`: Updated all with the new parameters

## Cleanup

- Created `cleanup_results.py` to manage results directory, keeping only the most recent run
- Created `update_config_files.py` to update all configuration files with the fixed parameters
- Removed temporary analysis and fix scripts that are no longer needed

## Next Steps

With more realistic holding costs implemented, the RL agent should now be able to learn more effectively without being overly penalized for maintaining inventory. Further improvements could focus on:

1. Optimizing pricing strategies
2. Refining demand forecasting
3. Tuning restock policies
4. Adjusting other environment parameters as needed
