# Enhanced Demand Modeling for MSME Environment

## Overview
The demand modeling has been enhanced to provide better R² values for all product categories. The enhanced models show significant improvement in fit quality:

| Category     | Basic R²   | Enhanced R² | Improvement |
|--------------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Electronics  | 0.785      | 0.815       | 3.8%        |
| Furniture    | 0.758      | 0.793       | 4.5%        |
| Clothing     | 0.692      | 0.731       | 5.7%        |
| Toys         | 0.690      | 0.734       | 6.4%        |
| Groceries    | 0.560      | 0.612       | 9.4%        |

Most categories exceed the R² > 0.7 threshold for good model performance, with only Groceries falling slightly below.

## Files
- `demand_models.pkl`: Standard log-log model parameters used by the MSME environment
- `enhanced_demand_models.pkl`: Enhanced models with additional features and better performance
- `data/enhanced_retail_store_inventory.csv`: Improved dataset with realistic industry parameters

## Environment Integration
The MSME environment automatically uses these models when `use_fitted_model=True` in the configuration. 
The models provide realistic elasticity values:
- Electronics: -1.38 (high elasticity, typical for electronics)
- Furniture: -1.22
- Clothing: -0.99
- Toys: -0.91
- Groceries: -0.48 (lower elasticity, typical for necessities)

## Usage
To use the enhanced models, simply ensure that the MSME environment loads the demand models:

```python
from environments.config import MSMEConfig
from environments.msme_env import MSMEEnvironment

config = MSMEConfig(
    product_category="Electronics",
    use_fitted_model=True  # This makes the environment use the fitted models
)

env = MSMEEnvironment(config)
# Continue with your reinforcement learning setup
```

The parameters are automatically loaded and used by the environment.
